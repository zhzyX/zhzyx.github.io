I'm a PhD student of Computer Science at George Washington University. I'm advised by [Dr. Robert Pless](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/), with a research focus on understanding images cross long time period and its application in agriculture.  

About my work
======
I'm working on understanding the relationship of hundards of sorghum cultivars using a large dataset from TERRA, that contains daily images of a large sorghum field. I use deep metric learning methods to build a image feature space. To better understand this learned feature space, I built a [visualization tool](https://github.com/zhzyx/embedding-visualization) that aim to understand relationship of different kind of labels of multimodal datasets in high dimensional space. Then I try to use this feature space to interpret different kind of phenotypes and genotypes  
I worked on [sorghum leaf morphological phenotyping](https://github.com/GWUvision/Sorghum-Leaf) from 3D scanner data. I built a [semi-automated annotation tool](https://github.com/zhzyx/sorghum-annotator) to label leaves. Use deep convolutional neural network to segment leaves, then use point cloud to build leaf voxel adjacency graph to extract phenotypes like leaf length and curvature.
